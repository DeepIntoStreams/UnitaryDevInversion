# On the determination of path signature from its unitary development

## Introduction

This repository is the official implementation of the paper "On the determination of path signature from its unitary development". The folder "Dev" is for the experiments on development-based models (RPCFD, OPCFD and PCFD[[1]](#1)). The folder "Sig MMDs" is for for the experiments on signature-based mmds[[2]](#2).
